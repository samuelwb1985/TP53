### Chemotherapy and mismatch repair deficiency cooperate to fuel TP53 mutagenesis and ALL relapse

##### This folder contains code for the manuscript "Chemotherapy and mismatch repair deficiency cooperate to fuel TP53 mutagenesis and ALL relapse."

##### This code runs mutational signature analysis on the WGS samples shown in the manuscript.

##### Bash scripts (with extensions ".sh") were run in alphabetical order (i.e. starting with the script "a_GetTarget_NonClustered.sh"). Most bash scripts call on a Python or Matlab script in this folder to perform their functions.

##### Additionally, a folder called "StrandBias" contains similar scripts for  determining the strand bias of mutations and mutational signatures.
